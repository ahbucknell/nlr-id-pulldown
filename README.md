# Analyis Pipeline for Boltz2 Multimer Predictions
This is a Snakemake pipeline to quickly analyse large sets of multimeric predictions generated by Boltz2.

## Dependencies
This pipeline requires and will automatically install (if necessary) [ipsae.py](https://github.com/DunbrackLab/IPSAE/blob/main/ipsae.py). A big thanks to Professor Roland Dunbrack Jr for his work on developing the ipSAE metric ([bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.10.637595 )).
